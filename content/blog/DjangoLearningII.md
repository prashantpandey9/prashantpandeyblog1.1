## Week II

I recently tried many things with django framework but I didn't create anything with it. I started a project name todoapp which stores the daily work deatil and delete when  things are over. I have no idea how to create this type of app with django framework, so i googled it and found some stuff about creating a todoapp. 


I started creating the app  with full  enthusiasm. But  not able to create it by my own.I copied some code from google and migrate all the data into database and try to run the server. But I don't know why, the app created problem.I have no idea what's going with that code. I tried to remove error,  some effort got success but some effort not enough to remove the error. 

So till now that app is not working!!!
